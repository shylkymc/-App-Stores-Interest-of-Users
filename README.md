# Interest of App Stores Users

I imagined what I can advice, if someone ask me to develop an app. I completed this project according to this question. I aimed to analyze interest of users. With the results, I could give advices. I used two data sets which are obtained from Apple Store and Google Play Store. I needed some data wrangling processes. There are a lot of types apps in the data sets. I focused on English named and free apps. I created new data sets according to this aim. After I prepared data sets, I started to create frequency tables. I created a frequency table for Apple Store data set while calculating number of rewievs on "Genre" column. For Google Play Store data set, I created a frequency table with number of installs on "Category" column. 
## Conclusion
For two of the data sets, the users have high interest to the apps which related with books or references. Books and references categories are not first for two of the data.However, it does not mean that it does not have potential. It can be a good start to create an app on books and references categories.
