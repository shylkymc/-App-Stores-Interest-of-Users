# Interest of App Store Users

I imagined what I could advize if someone asked me to develop an app. I completed this project according to this question. I aimed to analyze interest of users. With the results, I could give advice. I used two data sets which were obtained from the Apple Store and the Google Play Store. I needed some data wrangling processes. There are a lot of types of apps in the data sets. I focused on English named and free apps. I created new data sets according to this aim. After I prepared data sets, I started to create frequency tables. I created a frequency table for the Apple Store data set while calculating number of reviews on the "Genre" column. For the Google Play Store data set, I created a frequency table with number of installs on the "Category" column. 
## Conclusion
For two of the data sets, the users have high interest in the apps which relate to books or references. Books and references categories are not first for two of the data sets. However, it does not mean that it does not have potential. It can be a good start to create an app on books and references categories.
